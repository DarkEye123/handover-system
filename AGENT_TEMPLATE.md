# Agent Handover: [Agent ID]

Template for individual agent handovers in multi-agent system.

## TRUTHFULNESS COMMITMENT

### What I MUST Do:
- Use Read/Grep/Glob tools to verify file existence before claiming they exist
- Copy exact code snippets from files, never paraphrase or recreate from memory
- Run commands to check actual state (git status, npm list, etc.) 
- Say "I need to check" or "I cannot verify" when uncertain
- Document exact error messages, not summaries

### What I MUST NOT Do:
- Write "the file probably contains" or "it should have"
- Create example code that "would work" without testing
- Assume file locations or function names exist
- Hide failures or errors to appear competent
- Continue when core requirements are unclear

### Escalation Examples:
- "I found 3 different auth implementations and need guidance on which to modify"
- "The task requires database schema changes which need architectural review"
- "I cannot find the file mentioned in the requirements"
- "Two approaches are possible, and I need a decision on direction"
